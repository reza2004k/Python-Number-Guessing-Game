# 🔢 Python Console Number Guessing Game

This project is a classic "Guess the Number" game implemented in **Python 3**. It's a great beginner project for demonstrating basic input/output, random number generation, and recursive function calls in Python.

## ✨ Features

* **Random Number Generation:** The computer selects a random integer between 0 and 100.
* **Limited Attempts:** The player has a fixed number of chances (5 attempts) to guess the number.
* **Hints:** Provides feedback ("lower than this" or "upper than this") after each incorrect guess.
* **Score System:** Calculates a simple score based on the number of remaining chances when the player wins.
* **Console Interface:** Simple text-based interface for interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** `random` (for generating the secret number)
* **Interface:** Command Line / Terminal

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the number guessing game successfully, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python-Number-Guessing-Game.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python-Number-Guessing-Game.git)
    cd Python-Number-Guessing-Game
    ```
2.  **Run the Game:**
    Execute the Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python guess_number.py
    ```

### How to Play

1.  The game will immediately prompt you to enter your first guess for the number between 0 and 100.
2.  After each guess, the program will tell you if the secret number is **higher** or **lower** than your current guess.
3.  The game continues until you guess the correct number (You Win!) or run out of your 5 chances (You Lose!).
